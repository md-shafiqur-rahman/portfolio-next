## What Was the Problem?

Manually collecting product reviews and turning them into social media testimonials is time-consuming and inconsistent.

For businesses managing multiple products or plugins, this becomes even harder when:
- Reviews need to be monitored continuously
- Positive and negative reviews need different handling
- Low-rated reviews should be escalated to the team immediately
- Social proof content needs to be created fast
- Testimonial images need to be branded and visually consistent
- Product links should be shared carefully to avoid reducing post reach

They needed a system that could:
- Automatically monitor incoming product reviews
- Detect whether a review is positive or negative using AI
- Filter only high-quality reviews for social posting
- Route reviews by product automatically
- Generate post copy and branded testimonial creatives
- Publish the content to social media with proof links in comments
- Alert the internal team when bad or low-rated reviews appear

## What I Built

Using **n8n**, I built a fully automated review collection and testimonial posting system that tracks new reviews, filters them with AI, generates branded testimonial assets, and publishes them to social media automatically.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Scheduled Review Monitoring**
   - The workflow runs automatically every hour
   - It checks product **RSS review feeds** to detect whether any new review has been posted within the last hour
   - If no new review is found, the workflow stops
   - If a new review is found, it moves to the next step

2. **AI Sentiment Check**
   - An **AI agent** analyzes the incoming review
   - It determines whether the review is **positive** or **negative**
   - If the review is negative, the system immediately sends an alert email to the internal team
   - If the review is positive, the workflow continues

3. **Star Rating Validation**
   - A second AI/logic step checks the review rating
   - If the review is **greater than 4 stars**, it qualifies for testimonial creation
   - If the review is **4 stars or below**, the system sends an email alert to the team instead of posting it publicly

4. **Product-Based Routing**
   - Since the workflow handles multiple products/plugins, a **switch router** detects which product the review belongs to
   - The review is then sent to the correct product-specific branch

5. **AI Social Post Writing**
   - Inside the selected product branch, an AI agent writes a social media caption
   - The post is based on:
     - What the customer said in the review
     - Product value/highlights
     - A natural promotional tone suitable for testimonial content

6. **Reviewer Profile Scraping**
   - The workflow scrapes the reviewer profile to collect profile data
   - This includes checking whether a usable profile image is available
   - The goal is to make the testimonial more authentic by using the reviewer’s image when possible

7. **Human Image Detection**
   - Another AI/image analysis step checks whether the profile image contains a real human face
   - If the image is a valid human profile image, it is approved for the testimonial design
   - If not, the workflow skips using the profile image in the creative

8. **Dynamic Testimonial Template Generation**
   - A testimonial template built with **HTML + CSS** is used
   - The template dynamically inserts:
     - Reviewer name
     - Reviewer profile image (if valid)
     - Review text
     - Star rating
     - Product logo
     - Product branding elements
   - This ensures visually consistent testimonial posts across all products

9. **HTML to Image Conversion**
   - The generated testimonial template is converted into a **JPG image**
   - This final image is prepared for use as the social media post creative

10. **Automated Social Media Publishing**
   - The final testimonial image and AI-generated caption are published automatically to **Facebook**
   - The post also includes product value messaging and relevant hashtags for better engagement

11. **Comment-Based Proof & Product Links**
   - After publishing the post, the workflow automatically adds a comment containing:
     - The original review link
     - The product link
   - This is done intentionally because direct links inside the post can reduce reach
   - Keeping links in the comment helps preserve engagement while still providing proof and conversion paths
