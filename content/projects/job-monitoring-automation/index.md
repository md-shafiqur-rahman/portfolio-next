## What Was the Problem?

Manually checking company career pages and LinkedIn for new job openings is time-consuming and inefficient.

For recruiters, job seekers, or businesses tracking competitors — this process becomes even harder when:
- Multiple company career pages need to be monitored
- Different ATS systems are used across websites
- LinkedIn job updates are inconsistent
- There is no easy way to track **new vs existing jobs**

They needed a system that could:
- Automatically **scrape job listings** from career pages and LinkedIn
- Store and organize job data centrally
- Detect **new job openings intelligently**
- Allow **flexible scheduling** (daily, every 3 days, weekly, etc.)
- Eliminate manual checking completely

## What I Built

Using **n8n**, I built a fully automated job monitoring system that continuously tracks job openings across multiple sources and intelligently detects new opportunities using AI.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Trigger System**
   - A **manual trigger** is used to initially fetch and store job data when a new company is added
   - A **cron/schedule trigger** runs the workflow automatically at custom intervals (3, 5, 7, 10, 15, or 30 days)

2. **Job Source Input (Airtable)**
   - Stores:
     - Company name
     - Career page URL
     - LinkedIn company URL
   - Acts as the central control panel for job tracking

3. **Career Page Scraping (Firecrawl API)**
   - Scrapes job listings from any career page
   - Handles multiple ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever, custom sites, etc.)
   - Ensures reliable extraction regardless of site structure

4. **LinkedIn Job Scraping (Apify API)**
   - Extracts job listings directly from LinkedIn company pages
   - Complements career page data for complete coverage

5. **Data Processing & Structuring**
   - Parses raw job data into structured format
   - Standardizes job titles, links, and metadata
   - Stores results in Airtable

6. **AI-Powered Job Comparison (OpenAI)**
   - Compares newly scraped jobs with previously stored jobs
   - Detects whether a job is:
     - Existing (already stored)
     - New (unique opportunity)
   - Eliminates duplicates intelligently

7. **New Job Detection & Update**
   - If a new job is found:
     - It is marked as a **“New Unique Job”**
     - Airtable is updated automatically
   - Maintains a clean and up-to-date dataset

8. **Tracking & Status Logging**
   - Stores:
     - Last checking date
     - Career page check status
     - LinkedIn check status
   - Ensures full transparency and monitoring

## Key Technical Details

- Built using **n8n modular workflow architecture**
- Implemented **looping logic** to process multiple companies dynamically
- Used **AI Agent (OpenAI)** to compare job datasets and detect uniqueness
- Designed flexible scheduling using **cron triggers**
- Structured Airtable as a lightweight **CRM/database layer**
- Ensured compatibility with **multiple ATS systems** via Firecrawl
- Combined multiple data sources (Career Page + LinkedIn) into one unified pipeline
